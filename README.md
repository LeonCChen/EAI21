Embedded AI

## 1 Introduction

#### Assessment
Modify the NN at the end of the program to boost the performance of the NN. 
	You can make it deeper, wider, etc. 
Submit your Notebook or its link to your git under a new folder called: `Lab3_CNN`. Answer on top and add me “memoatwit” [1]:
- What is your MSE/MAE with linreg vs tuned network? 
- What happens to your train and test results if you add 5 hidden layers with 128 neurons each? 

## 2 Intro to convolution operations: padding

#### Assessment
Grab a pen/paper or your favorite note-taking device and follow the examples in the video on your own.

## 3 Convolution parameters: stride and pooling

#### Assessment
Follow the examples in the video on your own.  
Answer in your Git repo: 
If I apply pooling of 2 (2,2 window with a stride of 2) to a (6,6) array, what is the resulting size?

## 4 ConvNet Architectures, layers

#### Assessment
Follow the examples in the video on your own.  Answer in your Git repo:
What is my output size if: Input = (100,100), kernel size=(2,2), stride of 1 and no pooling? 
How many weights do I have if I have 24 such filters stacked (conv2_24)?
What is a better idea: To use one larger kernel (7,7) or multiple stacked smaller ones, 3x(3,3)? 
Solve for the padding (P), in terms of I, F and S, if we want the input and output size to remain the same. 


## 5 Practical patterns

#### Assessment





## Submission of assessments to Git
Create a repo on your favorite git (hub, lab, etc.)
call it EAI21
can be private
add me ('ergezerm@wit.edu' or 'memoatwit')
push code / add text
add Readme.md with link to results
Share the link to your repo with me on BrightSpace
